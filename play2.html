        <p class="speech">You are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe
            I am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken
            aback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are
            Uncle Jack’s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.</p>
        
            <h5 class="name algernon">ALGERNON</h5>
            <p class="speech">Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think
                that I am wicked.</p>
        
        <h5 class="name cecily">CECILY</h5>
        <p class="speech">If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very
            inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,
            pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would
            be hypocrisy</p>
